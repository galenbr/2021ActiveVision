Make sure gazebo could spawn the object first.

Change the file location according to the system in the following locations in the files:
In test_movement/src
camera_data_gen.cpp 435 
camera_data_gen.cpp 696

First Window: roslaunch franka_control test.launch
Second Window: rosrun testing_image_transport test_registration_testing
Third Window: rosrun test_movement camera_data_gen_node

The three lines would use the trained q table to guide the movement of the camera. Copying the code from the q-training.cpp and replace all the code in the camera_data_gen.cpp to train the q learning. 
For the testing, uncomment the line at camera_data_gen.cpp 665 to demonstrate the pointcloud.
