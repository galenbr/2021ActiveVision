image_stithing_new.cpp 81 "/panda_camera/depth/points" should match the kinect camera in gazebo

Make sure gazebo could spawn the object first.
Unzip the kinect.zip and copy the folder kinect to ~/.gazebo/models
Reference: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_depth_camera 

Change the file location according to the system in the following locations in the files:
In test_movement/src
camera_data_gen.cpp 436 (Commented out right now, use them if user wants to store the value) 
camera_data_gen.cpp 696

First Window: roslaunch franka_control test.launch
Second Window: rosrun testing_image_transport test_registration_testing
Third Window: rosrun test_movement camera_data_gen_node

The three lines would use the trained q table to guide the movement of the camera. Copying the code from the q-training.cpp and replace all the code in the camera_data_gen.cpp to train the q learning. 
For the testing, uncomment the line at camera_data_gen.cpp 665 to demonstrate the pointcloud.
