joint repository for the Manipulation and Environmental Robotics Lab

## Setup
To setup the ros workspace locally:
1. Go to the workspace location you want
2. Run 'git clone https://www.github.com/berkcalli/mer_lab.git'
3. Run 'catkin_make'

## *_moveit_config Files
These files generated by moveit can differ from project to project, even if the same robot is used

For this reason, we recommend the names of the config files to be changed from the default to avoid interference

The process to do so is as follows:
* No config file generated:
    1. Run moveit setup assistant:
    `rosrun moveit_setup_assistant moveit_setup_assistant`
    2. Click 'Create New Moveit Configuration Package'
    3. Fill out all necessary information on the robot
    4. When done, at the last page (Configuration Files), set the folder to be the custom config name:
    `mer_lab/src/projects/project_name_moveit_config`
    Replace project_name with the name of the project this moveit_config file is for
* Config file has already been generated:
    1. Run moveit setup assistant:
    `rosrun moveit_setup_assistant moveit_setup_assistant`
    2. Click Edit Existing Moveit Configuration Package
    3. Go to the last page (Configuration Files), and set the folder to be the new custom config name:
    `mer_lab/src/projects/project_name_moveit_config`
    Replace project_name with the name of the project this moveit_config file is for
    4. Try launching moveit from the required package that needs it and connecting to it
    5. If successfull, delete old moveit_config package
