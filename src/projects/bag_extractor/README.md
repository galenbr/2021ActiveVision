The Bag Extractor package allows one to automatically export experiment data from ROSBAGs to meaningful formats.

Image streams can be exported as Mp4
Whereas Messages on topics can be exported to csv files

Additionally, if you follow the recommended folder structure, you can use the included shell script to automate the entire process

NOTE: To export videos you need the image_view package and the ffmpeg package. Check the tutorial: http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Tutorials/Exporting%20image%20and%20video%20data
